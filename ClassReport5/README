The process for this class report was fairly straight-forward. In Vivado, I created an I2C slot and instantiated it in the top_level. In Xilinix, I used Chu's I2C function to read temperature data from the sensor.
I then multiplied that number by 100 to remove the decimal point. I loaded each digit of this number into an array, and used Chu's sseg function to push each digit to the sseg display, so all together, it shows the current
temperature sensor value.
